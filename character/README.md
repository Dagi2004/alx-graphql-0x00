# GraphQL Character Queries

This repository contains GraphQL queries to retrieve information about characters using a paginated API. The queries and their outputs are organized for ease of use and understanding.

## **Project Structure**

The files are organized in the following structure:

character/
README.md
characters-page-1.graphql
characters-page-1-output.json
characters-page-2.graphql
characters-page-2-output.json
characters-page-3.graphql
characters-page-3-output.json
characters-page-4.graphql
characters-page-4-output.json

### **File Descriptions**

- **`characters-page-1.graphql`**: Contains the GraphQL query to fetch characters from page 1.
- **`characters-page-1-output.json`**: JSON output of the query executed for page 1.
- **`characters-page-2.graphql`**: Contains the GraphQL query to fetch characters from page 2.
- **`characters-page-2-output.json`**: JSON output of the query executed for page 2.
- **`characters-page-3.graphql`**: Contains the GraphQL query to fetch characters from page 3.
- **`characters-page-3-output.json`**: JSON output of the query executed for page 3.

## **GraphQL Query Information**

### **Query Description**

The `characters(page: Int)` field is used to fetch a paginated list of characters from the API. Each query retrieves the following subfields for the characters:

- **`id`**: Unique identifier for the character.
- **`name`**: Name of the character.
- **`status`**: The current status of the character (e.g., Alive, Dead, Unknown).
- **`image`**: URL of the character's image.

## **Usage Instructions**

### **1. GraphQL Queries**

Each `.graphql` file contains a query for a specific page of characters. For example:

```graphql
query GetCharactersPage1 {
  characters(page: 1) {
    results {
      id
      name
      status
      image
    }
  }
}

2. Outputs
The .json files contain the output of the GraphQL queries after execution. These files are generated by running the GraphQL queries against the API.
ow to Run the Queries
Using Postman or GraphQL Playground:
Open Postman or a GraphQL playground.
Copy the contents of any .graphql file into the query editor.
Run the query and observe the results
```
